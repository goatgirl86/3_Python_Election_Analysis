# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this week’s assignment was to explore the capabilities Python to analyze data in a csv file.    

### Data Analyzed
The specific dataset analyzed included election data from congressional district in Colorado that included three counties and three candidates. Throughout our weekly modules, we began analyzing the data to determine results for each candidate.  For this challenge, we expanded our analysis to also include the county data and results.  
### Deliverables
The deliverable for this assignment was a prepare code that would properly calculate and write our election results to a text file.  

## Election Results
•	Total votes cast in the congressional district: 369,711
•	Counties in the congressional district and their corresponding votes/percentage of total votes:
o	Jefferson: 38,855 votes (10.5% of the total votes)
o	Denver: 306,055 votes (82.8% of the total votes)
o	Arapahoe: 24,801 votes (6.7% of the total votes)
•	County with largest number of votes: Denver
•	Candidates in the election and their corresponding votes/percentage of total votes:

•	Winning candidate: Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes (73.8% of the total votes)
